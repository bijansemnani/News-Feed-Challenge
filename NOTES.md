For this app the first thing I did was to install the npm package jquery as it was missing and causing the app to fail.  After that I noticed that the various components were being declared directly in the App.js file.  As a result I decided for organizational purposes to include a new folder called Components and house the various components in their own folders.  This helps to keep the app nice and clean and makes it easier for future developers to find the exact component they are looking for instead of searching through one large file. I also noticed that the TodoHeader file was a stateful component which seemed useless since it only had a title in it.  To keep the app consistent I changed that component to a functional one.
