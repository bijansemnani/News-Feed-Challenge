For this app the I decided to take the json data and split it into categories using the "type" property.  I first used the axios npm package to pull in the json feed into my app.  I then took that data and passed it into a NewsFeed component to then be displayed to the users.  On the news feed I added six buttons to act as a filter for the different object types.  I then would update the state of the component depending on which type the user picked (the default was all news feed data).  Once the state was updated only the type that the user chose would appear in the feed.  

Unfortunately I did not have enough time to fully style the page or implement the Semantic UI.
